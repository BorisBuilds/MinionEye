## What you need

 - Giant 7" (18cm) non-sticky googly eyes (I got them from Amazon) 
 - 3D Printer
 - 10x15 photo paper and printer (or use photo print shop around the corner)
 - All purpose glue
 - Scissors
 - Sharp knife
 - White cardboard or hard white plastic foil (if you want it weather resistant)

## How to make

 - Print the googly_eyes.stl file on your 3D Printer. I added gcode for Prusa MK3S+. It is hughe so it prints about 7-10 hours!
 - Gently remove the white cardboard from the googly eye. Srape of excess remains of the original cardboard from the transparent plastic. You dont need to make it too nice. The goggle will hide it anyway. <br><img alt="" width="400px" src="https://github.com/BorisBuilds/MinionEye/blob/main/Photos_how_to_make/how_to_make_1.jpg?raw=true" />
 - Take out the black cardboard pupil
 - Print out the minion_eye.jpg as 10x15mm format or print it in your foto store.<br><img alt="" width="400px" src="https://github.com/BorisBuilds/MinionEye/blob/main/Photos_how_to_make/how_to_make_2.jpg?raw=true" />
 - Cut it out and glue it on the original black cardboard pupil
 - Either flip the cardboard eye around or cut out a new one from white cardboard or white plastic foil.
 - Put in the pupil and glue the transparent cover back in place.<br><img alt="" width="400px" src="https://github.com/BorisBuilds/MinionEye/blob/main/Photos_how_to_make/how_to_make_3.jpg?raw=true" />
 - Glue the 3D printed goggles on top.
 - Voila! A real minion eye- Bee-do bee-do bee-do!
